# Code-Review

## Identified Issues:
- **Uninitialized Values:**
   - Variables value and Array lack initialization, affecting code behavior.

- **Poor Naming and Clarity:**
    - Unclear variable names like value, S, and n hinder code understanding.

- **Magic Numbers:**
     - Hardcoded 20 used repeatedly; replace with constants for better maintenance.

- **Complex Boolean Expressions:**
      -  Complex condition (Array[i] % 2 == 0 && Array[i] % 5 == 0 && Array[i] % 3 != 0) requires simplification.

- **Code Structure:**
  - Overloaded main() function; suggest breaking tasks into separate functions.

- **Potential Division by Zero:**
   - Risk of division by zero due to uninitialized variables or improper checks.
 
## Suggestions:

- **Initialization and Clarity:**
  - Initialize all variables and use clear, descriptive names for better understanding.

- **Avoid Magic Numbers:**
  - Replace hardcoded values with named constants or variables for readability.
- **Simplify Boolean Expressions:**
  - Break complex conditions into simpler, more understandable parts.
- **Refactor Code Structure:**
   - Divide tasks into functions for improved organization and readability.
- **Prevent Division by Zero:**
   - Implement checks to avoid potential division by zero scenarios.

 ## Conclusion:

This review outlines crucial areas needing attention: initialization, naming clarity, simplification, code structuring, and error prevention. Addressing these issues will result in more maintainable, comprehensible, and robust code.
