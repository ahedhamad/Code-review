# Code-Review

##Identified Issues:
- **Uninitialized Values:**
   - Variables value and Array lack initialization, affecting code behavior.

- **Poor Naming and Clarity:**
    - Unclear variable names like value, S, and n hinder code understanding.

- **Magic Numbers:**
     - Hardcoded 20 used repeatedly; replace with constants for better maintenance.

- **Complex Boolean Expressions:**
      - Complex condition (Array[i] % 2 == 0 && Array[i] % 5 == 0 && Array[i] % 3 != 0) requires simplification.

- **Code Structure:**
  - Overloaded main() function; suggest breaking tasks into separate functions.

- **Potential Division by Zero:**
   - Risk of division by zero due to uninitialized variables or improper checks.
